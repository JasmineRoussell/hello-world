# hello-world
Covid Coder. I'm learning to code during the Covid-19 Pandemic. I'm sure, I'm not the only one.
I'm a holistic wellness practitioner and stay at home mom. I'm learning to code so that I can be apart of shaping the future through technology and so that I can one day teach these skills to my daughter. I will like to thank the Uber Eats and Amazon developers for making my life easier. You are the Real MVPs. Coders are the new rock stars.
